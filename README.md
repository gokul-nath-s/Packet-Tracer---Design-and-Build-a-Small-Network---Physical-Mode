## Project Title

**Packet Tracer - Design and Build a Small Network - Physical Mode**

## Project Description

The project focuses on designing a small network with multiple devices, configuring them with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, securing them with SSH and encrypted passwords, and testing the connections to ensure proper communication. This was achieved using Cisco Packet Tracer, a powerful network simulation tool.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/Packet-Tracer-Network.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Packet-Tracer-Network
    ```
3. **Open the project in Cisco Packet Tracer:**
    - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
    - Open the .pkt file from the cloned repository.

## Usage

1. **Open Cisco Packet Tracer and load the project file.**
2. **Explore the network topology:**
    - Examine the configured switches, routers, and PCs.
3. **Test the network connections:**
    - Use the ping tool to verify connectivity between devices.
4. **Review the security configurations:**
    - Check the SSH settings and encrypted passwords on the devices.
